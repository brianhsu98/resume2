# Brian Hsu's Resume

This is my resume!

It's written in LaTeX, using [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV). It's currently hosted on Github Pages, and a PDF can be found [here](https://brianhsu.me/resume2/Resume_BrianHsu.pdf), or in the repo itself.

There's also some custom hacky stuff throughout -- check out changes to `awesome-cv.cls`.
