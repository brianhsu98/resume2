\item Senior engineer on the \href{https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477132.3483578}{Resource Allowance System} team, \textbf{designing and implementing capacity allocation workflows} for \textbf{thousands of customers} across \textbf{millions of machines}. 
\item Helped develop \textbf{IaaS Experimentation}, a system for users to acquire hardware, run containers, and apply custom automation for the purpose of testing different workloads on different hardware. Onboarded and supported customers, designed and implemented features, and came up with new projects for other team members. 
\item Designed and implemented systems to \textbf{automatically distribute and reclaim servers} from customers, providing them with necessary fault-tolerance buffer. 
\item Worked on a system to move servers between customers while maintaining proper capacity accounting, helping us solve tough problems like fleet maintenance, fleet spread, and hardware scheduling. 
\item \textbf{Mentored junior members} of my team and came up with a large variety of projects to aid in their engineering development.
