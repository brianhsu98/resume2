          \item Worked with a variety of big data systems, helping add to, segment, and process petabytes of customer data to enable data-driven marketing.
          \item Developed and owned a backend service, including a new big data pipeline, for a new product. Worked under and met a tight deadline to meet client demands, unlocking \$12 million in at-risk revenue.
          \item Containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes, increasing development velocity, enabling scalability, and improving fault tolerance.         
          \item Improved the efficiency of mission-critical applications, and increased visibility into errors by adding fault-detection logic.
          \item Collaborated across teams, implementing new endpoints to enable easier access to my team's systems.
          \item Migrated several applications from an on-premises data center to Google Cloud Platform as part of a company-wide shift to the cloud

        \begin{cvitems}
          \item Researched and helped develop variations of novel computer science practice problems, helping make computer science more accessible and easier-to-learn.
          \item Collaboratively designed and implemented an interactive web application allowing students to solve Parsons Problems, enabling a 80+ student study. 
          \item Developed a system for automatically grading student submissions at scale safely and efficiently, using multiple workers coordinated using Redis/RQ.
          \item Analyzed and visualized data, providing insights into the learning efficacy of Parsons Problems.
          \item Worked with PhD student Nate Weinman, under Professor Armando Fox.
